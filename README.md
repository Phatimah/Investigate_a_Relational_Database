# Investigate a Relational Database

In this project, I used SQL to investigate a database relating to movie rentals. I wroteÂ SQL code to execute SQL queries and provided helpful database-related information. I created visualizations to display the results of my SQL queries after running the queries.

[Here are the resources files](https://github.com/Phatimah/Investigate_a_Relational_Database/tree/main/all_project_files).

## CRITERIA TO BE MET:
1. The student can write error-free SQL queries.
2. All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
3. The student can use JOINs correctly in SQL queries.
